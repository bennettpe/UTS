# UTS
This is Amdahl's UTS from 1975, a Unix v6 meant for the S/370 architecture. It can only run under VM/370, not directly on the hardware. 

Installation

Make it visible as a 2314 to VM/370 and crate a direcotry entry for UTS like this: (will provide when I find the directory statmeent)


This UTS is a verbatim doppel-gaenger of UNIX version 6 for VM/370, if you go and build lthat system. So this leads me and others to believe this UTS is actually a Unix v6. 


Enjoy
